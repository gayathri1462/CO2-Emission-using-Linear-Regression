# CO2-Emission-using-Linear-Regression
Using scikit-learn to implement simple linear regression and a dataset that is related to fuel consumption and Carbon dioxide emission of cars. Then, we split our data into training and test sets, create a model using training set, Evaluate model using test set, and finally use model to predict unknown value using simple linear regression.
